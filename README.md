# FabAcademy2015_PSoC4_WS2812Testing

This is a simple program for PSoC Creator to put a rainbow pattern on some Ws2812b LEDs using the PSoC 4 CY8CKIT-049 4200 prototyping kit. It's setup to run using the PSoC 4 breakout board that I designed. You can 
find the design files for the board on my [GitHub](https://github.com/icchalmers/FabAcademy_PSoC4_Breakout).

Assuming everything is working OK, you should see a rainbow pattern on the LEDs.

The code is part of my [Fab Academy 2015](http://www.fabacademy.org/) at [Fab Lab Strathclyde](http://www.strath.ac.uk/fablab/). You can follow the process on [my class website](http://fabacademy.org/archives/2015/eu/students/chalmers.iain/index.html). The content is also mirrored to [my GitHub Pages site](http://icchalmers.github.io/).

# If files are missing...

I've tried to match what files are needed in source control but have a feeling some might be missing (especially UART bootloader stuff, as that's in another project). If you have any trouble, everything should be archived completely in the .zip!
